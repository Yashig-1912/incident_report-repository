"Bullying","Two boys from the class were constantly bullying another boy. They started with mocking him for his clothes. Then they went on to talk about his family, his caste and his background. The boy was not able to speak anything. No one including myself took a strong stand for the boy. We tried to stop them but they wouldn't listen. The victim is very scared and cannot gather the courage to report the boys. The incident occurred in room no 505 after the last lecture ended. Other than 2 boys and the victim, 5 people including me were present.  ","2025-05-21","Classroom","2025-07-19T15:01:12.671Z"
